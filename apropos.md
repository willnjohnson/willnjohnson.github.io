<p>
When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me sipping coffee ‚òï or tea üçµ while diving into random Wiktionary pages or other articles, experimenting with new food recipes for my next meal, or having fun on my Nintendo Switch. I enjoy brain-teasers ‚Äî from solving crossword metas to playing tabletop and board games like <em>Exit The Game</em> or online games like <em>Wordle</em> and <em>Connections</em> with my sister and brother-in-law. I‚Äôm endlessly curious, whether it‚Äôs learning a new skill, reading obscure facts, or discovering the little joys in everyday life.
</p>
<p>
That same curiosity drives my aspiration as a versatile and self-driven computer scientist, where I explore both the technical and creative aspects of software development. I like to approach challenges playfully and thoughtfully, blending logic, experimentation, and imagination to build solutions that are both functional and elegant.

      <h4>Beginning</h4>
      <p>
      Learned the basics of <strong>HTML</strong>.  
      At the time, I was more interested in the creativity than the code itself‚Äîmaking profile layouts on Myspace, customizing Neopets pages, and experimenting with sites like Weebly and Tumblr. It was playful tinkering, but it set the stage for how I would later view programming as both art and logic.

      <h4>Creative Phase</h4>
      <p>
      Fiddled with various software in Adobe Creative Suite 5. Worked with <strong>ActionScript</strong>, <strong>ColdFusion</strong>, and <strong>DreamWeaver</strong>, primarily focusing on web design and frontend web development.  
      Began exploring breaking things with <em>Array-of-Bytes</em> and RAM editing.

      <h4>High School Coding Years</h4>
      <p>
      Learned <strong>Visual Basic</strong> and <strong>Java</strong> in class. Introduced to Capture the Flag challenges through <em>PicoCTF</em>, which combined logic, creativity, and technical knowledge in a way that immediately drew me in.

      <h4>Exploration</h4>
      <p>
      While pursuing an Associate's degree at Community College, I took advantage of free online school resources and went through online courses at Lynda.com to advance my knowledge in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>, and deeply following emerging tech trends.

      <h4>Continued Exploration</h4>
      <p>
      Learned React Native for mobile development. Began maintaining online <strong>wikis</strong> and writing extensively in <strong>Markdown</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong>.

      <h4>Mobile Development</h4>
      <p>
      Started experimenting with <strong>Expo Go</strong> and <strong>TestFlight</strong>, deploying and testing apps in a mobile-first environment. This hands-on approach gave me a better sense of the developer workflow and how users interact with software on different devices. Also worked with unit and integration testing through Mocha and Postman.

      <h4>Backend Development</h4>
      <p>
      Worked extensively with <strong>Redux</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, and <strong>Solidity</strong>.  
      Started <em>Project Snow</em> with a small community of online friends, a fork of Ethereum designed to explore and address issues in Ethereum Classic. Though the project was eventually abandoned, it was a valuable experience in understanding the scope and challenges of blockchain development.

      <h4>Small Red Teaming Community</h4>
      <p>
      Joined a small community called Foxtrot (under the pseudonym "Guiled Fox" <a href="https://x.com/guiled">ü¶ä</a>, a pun on the name Guy Fawkes) and focused on tools such as <strong>BurpSuite</strong> and <strong>Postman</strong> to analyze and test web applications. This sharpened my ability to think critically about security and system vulnerabilities.

      <h4>University Studies</h4>
      <p>
      Completed a degree in Computer Science, with significant work in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>.  
      These years solidified both my theoretical and practical understanding of programming and systems.
      </p>
      <p>Graduated with B.S. in C.S. in Spring 2023 with a minor in Cybersecurity, Summa Cum Laude with a 4.0 GPA. Worked in a team on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6p9pZ06ykc">autonomous racing senior design capstone project</a> where our team constructed the vehicle (FPGA, LIDAR), and used reward-based reinforcement learning to train in the vehicle in simulation through the F1TENTH gym environment and physically test the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Pursued Master's degree and graduated with M.S. in C.S. in December 2024.</p>
