When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me sipping {% include badge.html icon="mug-hot" text="coffee" %} or {% include badge.html icon="glass-water-droplet" text="tea" %} while diving into reading random Wiktionary/Wikisource pages or other articles, experimenting with new food recipes for my next meal, or having fun on my Nintendo Switch. I enjoy brain-teasers — from solving crossword metas to playing tabletop and board games or online games like *Wordle* and *Connections*. I’m endlessly curious, whether it’s learning a new skill, reading obscure facts, or discovering the little joys in everyday life.

That same curiosity drives my aspiration as a versatile and self-driven computer scientist, where I explore both the technical and creative aspects of software development. I like to approach challenges playfully and thoughtfully, blending logic, experimentation, and imagination to build solutions that are both functional and elegant.

## Teachings and Research

### Classes Taught
During my time as a graduate teaching assistant, I supported multiple courses through grading, teaching meetings, and office hours. I aided students in understanding complex concepts, troubleshooting technical documentation, and completing assignments. I've also written Python gradescripts to facilitate evaluating program correctness and I managed a Portainer server that hosted class assignments. Courses I assisted with include:

| Semester   | Course                     | Type       |

### Research
As an undergraduate research assistant, I investigated the stability of altcoins in the cryptocurrency market, comparing them with established coins using statistical analysis. My contributions included categorizing coins by trade volume, developing a peak‑finding algorithm based on a sliding window approach, implementing and improving web scraping tools (Selenium) to collect repository data, and building tools to compare altcoin and parent coin files. I organized research findings in Notion and collaborated with a graduate research assistant to refine the project.

**Tools Used:**

## Additional Interests

- **Linguistics** — particularly evolutionary linguistics, studying how words change, split, or vanish across time, but also interested in the mathematical-side of linguistics (regular expressions, Turing Machines, etc.).  
- **Classic and Medieval Literature** — fascinated by old stories.  
- **Cybersecurity** — continuously developing a secure mindset. Ooh, a [CTF?](/ctf) (¬‿¬)
