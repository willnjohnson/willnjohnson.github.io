Up for a fun challenge? I've hidden flags, formatted `wnj-ctf-{<string>}`, across this site.

#### 1. Julius Was Here
`It looks legible, but something isn't quite right about it... qhd-wnz-{fusion}`

#### 2. Ready for Inspection
`What you see isn’t all you get. Some things hide between the lines.`
<!-- Who would ever think to check the comments? wnj-ctf-{i_inspect_therefore_i_persist} -->

#### 3. Use the Map
`Every journey leaves a trail. This one might be drawn out for you already. Can you spot it?`

#### 4. I, For One, Welcome Our New Robot Overlords
`Bzzt. Cannot compute. Bzzt, we've hidden the flag.`

#### 5. I Can Has Cookie?
`Sometimes what’s baked right in isn’t quite right. Maybe a little tweak will make it taste better.`

#### 6. Keep Digging
`The surface doesn’t tell the whole story. Some answers are buried deep.`

#### 7. Oops! I Dropped My Key
`The admin leaked his private PGP key, but it's locked behind a passphrase. Hmm. Maybe ask John for some help to uncover what's lurking in the shadow. (Hint: Passphrase is 6 letters mixed case)`

#### 8. A Key Distinction
`Hmm. I can't seem to find the right key to open the door. All I remember was p=2q+k, and k being small.`
