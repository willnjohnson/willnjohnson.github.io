# Freelance

I like to build software and tools for online communities in my spare time. If you need a desktop application, a simple website, a bot, or a custom tool, I may be able to help.

---

## What I Can Do

- Desktop applications {% include badge.html items="windows:brands:Windows,linux:brands:Linux" %}
- Websites and web tools {% include badge.html items="react:brands:ReactJS,js:brands:Javascript,sass:brands:SCSS,css3:brands:CSS,html5:brands:HTML" %}
- Discord bots {% include badge.html items="windows:brands:C#,python:brands:Python" %}
- Automation scripts {% include badge.html items="terminal:solid:Linux Shell,terminal:solid:Powershell,python:brands:Python" %}
- Mobile applications {% include badge.html items="react:brands:React Native" %}
- Game mods {% include badge.html items="code:solid:Lua,python:brands:Python,unity:brands:C#" %}
- School programming assignments / tutoring 
  (I can provide guidance, debugging help, or optimization advice, but I expect you to make a first attempt and show your work. I won’t do your class assignments from scratch; I have my own code of ethics.)

Feel free to ask, if you're unsure.

Languages I’m most comfortable with include **Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS**.  
I also have experience with **React, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and more**.

## How It Works
- Send me an email describing your project in the following format:

```
Project Name:
(Short title for your project — e.g., "Mazesolver")

Project Description:
(A few sentences describing what you want built. What does it do? Who uses it? What problem does it solve?)

Goals:
(Key outcomes or must-haves — e.g., speed, design simplicity, compatibility, specific features)

Platform:
(Where it should run — e.g., Windows desktop, Linux, web app, mobile app, browser extension, etc.)

Budget & Timeline:
(How much you can spend and when you’d like it done — even a rough idea helps)

Other Notes:
(Links, design documents, references, examples, screenshots, supporting assets (graphics, fonts, etc.), or anything else I should know)
```

- I’ll reply with whether I can help and what it might cost.
- If we agree, I’ll get to work and deliver the request.
