# Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of projects! Here, you'll find a showcase of different programming projects I've worked on, from academic projects to personal explorations in software development.

You can find my various works on {% include badge.html icon="github" style="brands" text="GitHub" link="https://github.com/willnjohnson" %}.
## Past Projects

My past projects span both academic coursework and personal explorations. Several were developed as university assignments: **WeatherApp** was a comprehensive semester-long project for my Software Engineering class, **Icarus** a two-week Computer Graphics assignment, and **4DOF Manipulation** a Human-Computer Interaction project. Others, like **Shapeshifter Helper**, **ChatGPT Bulk Deleter**, and **SigTail**, were created for personal use or to serve online communities, demonstrating my interest in practical problem-solving across different domains.

In my development work, I enjoy exploring diverse technologies and programming paradigms. I frequently experiment with different languages and frameworks. This curiosity has led me to create various scripts or tools to make life more convenient, or to just have fun.
